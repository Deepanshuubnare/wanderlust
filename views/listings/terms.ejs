      By using our platform, you agree to comply with all applicable laws and respect the rights of other users and property owners. We act solely as a marketplace connecting hosts with guests and do not own or manage any of the listed properties. Users are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide and for honoring bookings made through the platform. Cancellation policies, fees, and check-in/check-out times are defined by the individual host and must be reviewed prior to booking. Our property categorization and filtering are based on predefined keyword-matching techniques applied to listing titles and descriptions. While we strive to ensure accurate classification, some listings may appear in multiple categories or may be misclassified due to keyword overlap. Users are encouraged to carefully read descriptions and review images before making a booking. Misuse of the platform, fraudulent activity, or violation of these terms may result in account suspension or legal action. Continued use of our services implies acceptance of these terms.
